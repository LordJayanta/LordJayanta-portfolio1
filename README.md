# LordJayanta - Portfolio 1

This is simple protfolio, create by [LordJayanta](https://github.com/LordJayanta) using Reactjs. For the UI in this project I am using a figma design, which I got from the figma community, and this is the link to that design.

> NOTE: There was only dextop ui, so I improved it more during development
